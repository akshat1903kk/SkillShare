## Overview

This project is a web application designed to simulate a "SkillShare" or course-sharing site. It includes backend logic for handling users, courses, and authentication, as well as a frontend template structure for rendering the user interface.

## Technology Stack

* **Backend:** Python (likely using Flask or FastAPI)
* **Database:** SQLAlchemy (as inferred from `models.py` and `database.py`)
* **Frontend:** Jinja2 (for HTML templating), CSS, and JavaScript
* **Server:** Uvicorn / Gunicorn (or a lightweight development server)

## Project Structure

The repository is organized in a standard Python web application structure:



SkillShare/
├── .venv/                \# Virtual environment (should be gitignored)
├── **pycache**/          \# Python cache (should be gitignored)
├── routes/               \# Application routes (e.g., auth, courses)
├── static/               \# Static files (CSS, JS, images)
├── templates/            \# HTML templates (Jinja2)
├── database.py           \# Database connection and session setup
├── main.py               \# Main application entry point
├── models.py             \# SQLAlchemy database models
└── requirements.txt      \# Python dependencies



## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of the project up and running for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

* [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/akshat1903kk/SkillShare.git](https://github.com/akshat1903kk/SkillShare.git)
    cd SkillShare
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    * **Windows:**
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    * **macOS / Linux:**
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Database Setup:**
    *(You may need to add a step here to initialize your database, e.g., running migrations or creating tables. This is a common placeholder.)*
    ```bash
    # Example: python create_tables.py
    ```

## Usage

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the application using the main file.

```bash
# This command may vary depending on how main.py is set up
# It's often one of the following:
python main.py
# or
uvicorn main:app --reload
# or
flask run
````

After running the command, open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` (or the port specified in the terminal output).

### **Recommendation: Add a `.gitignore` file**

To keep your repository clean, I strongly recommend you add a `.gitignore` file to the main `SkillShare/` directory. This will prevent you from committing temporary files like `.venv` and `__pycache__`.

Create a file named `.gitignore` and add the following content:

```

# Python

**pycache**/
\*.pyc
\*.pyo
\*.pyd

# Virtual Environment

.venv/
venv/
ENV/

# OS-specific

.DS\_Store
Thumbs.db

```
```
